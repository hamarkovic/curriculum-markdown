## Education

**Beginning Sep 2019** <br>
**University of Oregon** - the Institute of Molecular Biology, Biology PhD program  

**Sep 2015 - Jun 2019** <br>
**University of California, Los Angeles** - B.Sc. in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology
with a minor in Biomedical Research    

**Aug 2011 - Jun 2015** <br>
**Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton, CA** - High School Diploma 

## Research Experience

**Apr 2017 - present** <br>
**Undergraduate Researcher at Sagasti Lab, UCLA** <br>
The Sagasti lab focuses on skin and
 sensory neuron morphogenesis in zebrafish. Projects I have investigated include the
 effect of Map2k7 mutation on embryonic development, the expression
 patterns of Map3k12 and Map3k13 during development, and the
 effect on neuronal regeneration of Map3k12 and Map3k13.

**Jun - Aug 2018** <br>
**Summer Intern at Nicholson Lab, OHSU** <br>
  The Nicolson lab focuses on the mechanisms of mechanotransduction
in zebrafish sensory hair cells. As part of the NGP/Vollum Summer
Undergraduate Program, I was awarded a summer fellowship to do
research full-time at the Nicolson Lab at OHSU. I investigated the
possibility of correcting a cdh23 mutation in zebrafish using the
targeted RNA-editing enzyme ADAR2.

**Jan - Mar 2017** <br>
**Undergraduate Researcher at De Robertis Lab, UCLA** <br>
The De Robertis lab focuses on early development of frog and mouse
embryos. Here, I learned plasmid cloning and basic laboratory skills. 

**Mar - Jun 2016** <br>
**Student in Biomedical Research 10H: Research Training in Genes, Genetics, and Genomics** <br>
Biomedical Research 10H is a course designed to give undergraduates
early experience in research. This class has published 2 papers in
peer-reviewed journals, with 134 and 264 undergraduate authors. The
class focuses on determining essential genes for hematopoiesis in
Drosophila, and students aid in this research by performing crosses
and imaging larvae to screen for changes in lymph node morphology.
  
## Presentations

**Aug 2018**<br>
**2018 Biomedical Research Minor Summer Poster Symposium** <br>
This is an annual poster session for the Biomedical Research Minor.
I presented a poster on my work from the Nicolson Lab in using ADAR2
to correct a cdh23 mutation in zebrafish sensory hair cells. 

**Aug 2018** <br>
**Research Internship Poster Symposium** <br>
Hosted by the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, this poster session
encompassed all summer internship programs at OHSU. I presented a
poster on my work from the Nicolson Lab in using ADAR2 to correct a
cdh23 mutation in zebrafish sensory hair cells.

competitive and provides fellowships for those admitted. 

**2015 - 2019** <br>
**11-time Dean's Honors List recipient (UCLA)** <br>
The Dean's Honors List recognizes high scholastic acheivement in
any one term.

## Activities

**Mar 2016 - present** <br>
**Tau Beta Sigma, Epsilon Kappa Chapter** <br>
*Secretary (Jun 2017 - Jun 2018)* <br>
Tau Beta Sigma is the co-educational National Honorary Band Service
 Sorority, dedicated to service for college band programs. I was the
 2017-2018 Secretary and a member of the chapter’s officer board. 
As Secretary, I took minutes, corresponded with other chapters, 
and managed attendance requirements and the calendar. 

**Sep 2015 - present** <br>
**UCLA Bruin Marching Band** <br>
*Woodwind Rank Leader (Apr 2016 - present)* <br>
The UCLA Bruin Marching Band is comprised of over 250 members and
performs at all home football and basketball games in addition to
various Olympic sporting events and hired gigs. I have been a
Woodwind Rank Leader and a member of the Band Staff since 
April 2016. As Woodwind Rank Leader, I help plan future performances and
pep songs for the band in addition to teaching marching fundamentals,
teaching members their positions on the football field, and 
supervising band members during rehearsals.
